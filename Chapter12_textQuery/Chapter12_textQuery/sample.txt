Since I go to middle school, I live far away from my home
town, I have few time to stay with my grandma who can cook 
the delicious food for me. On this weekend, I decided to 
go back hometown and visited my grandparents. When they saw 
me, they were so happy, grandma went to the kitchen and
prepared the food. As I grew up, I went to the kitchen 
to help her, I found my grandma¡¯s hands were so dry and
wrinkled. Thinking about her old time to take care of my
father, and then take care of me, she was a great woman,
in my heart, her hands were the most beautiful hands.
When I was in middle school, I heard the English song
Baby One More Time. Then I saw the music record, the girl was 
so sweet and pretty. She danced so well in the record, she
was full of energy. Since then, I fell in love with Britney
Spears, every girl wanted to be her. She was not only beautiful,
but also could sing and dance so well. Britney Spears was my 
early idol, her energetic image attracted me so much. I was
so crazy about her at that time. I believe that in every 
teenager¡¯s dream, they will have an idol.Two years ago,
I saw a horrible movie, in the movie, the spider became
a monster and ate people, from then now, I was afraid of
spider very much. When I see the spider, I will cry out 
and try to run away. My parents explained to me that the 
spider won¡¯t become a monster in the real life, the movie
is not real at all, but I am still afraid of the spider. One
day, my father took out a bottle, a spider was inside it, he
told me that the spider was just a small animal, it will knit
mesh. I looked at the animal carefully, then I found the spide
r was so lovely, I am not afraid of spider anymore.
